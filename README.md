# hotkey-app

## Purpose

I'm making this little peace of software to improve my workspace.

I have a lot of software to work with. And I very like keyboard-centric approach.
Also, I'm vim-oriented programmer. So I have an idea to make application which will store and show hotkeys for my current active window. And improve my skills with electron, of course.

## Planning features

- Keyboard-centric software
- Minimalistic
- Configurable

## Todo

- Showing hotkeys for current window
- Way to change hotkeys
- Storing data
